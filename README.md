# Epi_Doppler
Epi_Doppler v1** is a JSFX spatial movement tool for REAPER that simulates Doppler and distance behavior using a moving source around a listener. Motion can be **Linear** or **Custom Path**, and the sound is shaped by distance‑based delay, attenuation, panning, optional air absorption, stereo width, and output gain.
